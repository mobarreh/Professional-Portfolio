# Professional-Portfolio

Hi! This site aims to be a portfolio of the myself and the work I created during my journey as a Full-Stack Web-Developer for public view.

Alternately, as I am in my early stages of my career, there is a lack of projects. Therefore, I have used sample projects to show the function of this portfolio.

Below are images of the code and the results it produces:
